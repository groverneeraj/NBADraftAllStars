# NBADraftAllStars
Made a waffle to visualize the all-stars that were drafted in the posted for past 10 years.

I was also fascinated with waffle charts, today I finally managed to create one in R (ggplot2) with most help from the Liam Gilbey ggwaffle library. 

I visualized the all-stars that came out of NBA lottery in the past 10 years starting 2016 (2016 draft is the most recent one to have an all star, Ben Simmons)

I think I found the reason why Atlanta Hawks traded their 8th pick this year too.

Also it has been more than 30 years since the last time a 14th pick made All-Star!
